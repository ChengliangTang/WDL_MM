# Wasserstein Distributional Learning via Majorization-Minimization


## Introduction
This is the GitHub repo for paper *Wasserstein Distributional Learning via Majorization-Minimization*.

## Data

### Abstract
There are two real-world applications in our paper.

The data sets for the climate modeling are the daily temperature data from Berkeley Earth and the physical driver data from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The data sets for the income modeling are the income distribution data from American Community Survey (ACS) and the county-level health indices of from the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps program
 
In our experiment, we first calculated quantile and density functions from the raw point data. We then performed analyses using these transformed distribution functions.

### Availability
The data sets used in this paper are publicly availalable and the access links are provided in the Description section.

## Code

### Description
The WDL algorithm is implemented in Python 3. All the function definitions can be found in folder **lib/WDL.py**.

The first comparison method Frechet regression is implemented using the R package `frechet`.

The second comparison method CLR regression is implemented by adapting the R codes from the reference paper **Talská, R., Menafoglio, A., Machalová, J., Hron, K., & Fišerová, E. (2018). Compositional regression with functional response. Computational Statistics & Data Analysis, 123, 66-85**.
